Programs and media for my interactive installation Sting or Sing

SpacechimeLEDs has the arduino file for taking input from an MPR121 and changing the colors of 4 LED's in response to the touches, as well as sending the touch messages out the TX pin via Serial.

Spacechime PD patch reads the input from the serial bus coming from an XBee Explorer dongle and triggers additive synthesis warbles that drift in pitch over time.
